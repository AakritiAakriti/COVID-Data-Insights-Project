# COVID-Data-Insights-Project

## Overview

This project involves the exploration of COVID-19 data using SQL queries. Various aspects of the data are analyzed, such as total cases, total deaths, death percentages, infection rates, and vaccination statistics. The SQL queries utilize skills like Joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, and the creation of Views.

## Data Sources

**CovidDeaths:** Dataset containing information about COVID-19 cases and deaths.
**CovidVaccinations:** Dataset containing information about COVID-19 vaccinations.

## SQL Queries

### 1. Basic Data Exploration
The initial queries retrieve relevant information from the CovidDeaths dataset, focusing on continents and countries.

### 2. Analysis of Death Percentage and Population Infection Rates
Analyzing death percentages in countries with "states" in their names.
Examining the percentage of population infected with COVID-19.

### 3. Country and Continent-Level Analysis
Identifying countries with the highest infection rates and death counts per population.
Breaking down data by continent and highlighting continents with the highest death counts per population.

### 4. Global Numbers
Presenting global statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentages.

### 5. Vaccination Data Analysis
Analyzing the relationship between total population and COVID-19 vaccinations.
Utilizing CTEs and Temp Tables for calculating rolling vaccination percentages.

## Usage
The queries are written in SQL and can be executed in a compatible database environment.

## Views and Temporary Tables
The project demonstrates the use of Views and Temporary Tables for organizing and storing intermediate results.

### 6. Creating a View
I created a view named "PercentPopulationVaccinated" is created for later visualizations.

## Visualizations
Visualizations can be created using the stored data or by adapting the provided queries for integration with visualization tools.
